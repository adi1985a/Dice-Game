## Description
A C++ console application simulating a dice game. Players roll two dice over 10 rounds (or until funds run out), winning money/points for sums of 7/11, losing for 2/3/12, or earning points for other sums. Features ASCII dice art, colorful UI, and win multipliers. Created by Adrian Lesniak.

- Track money, points, and high score
- Display ASCII dice

   - Win/lose money or earn points based on sum
   - Track consecutive wins for multiplier

- Points: 100 for wins, sum Ã— 5 for other sums.
- Uses Windows-specific console functions for color and keypress handling.
- Random number generation seeded with current time.
